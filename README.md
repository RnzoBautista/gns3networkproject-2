# NETWORK PROJECT #2
<h2 align="center">Dual-Site Enterprise Network Design in GNS3 | SD-WAN + BGP + Route-Map Configuration</h2>

![Network Topology](/NetworkProject-2.png)

**Overview:**
This GNS3 lab demonstrates a dual-site enterprise network (HQ and Branch) with:
- SD-WAN design concepts (policy-based path selection / failover)
- BGP (iBGP/eBGP) between sites and ISPs
- Route-maps (AS-path prepend / local preference) to influence routing
- IPsec tunnels for site-to-site secure connectivity (tunnel over dynamic routing)

Check my youtube channel for the actual configuration.
